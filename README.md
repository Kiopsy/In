# Blood Sugar Stabilization User Manual:
## Steps for Compilation:
1. Ensure Python 3.8 is downloaded:  
2. Within Gradescope I have submitted a zip titled Blood_Sugar.zip. Download, unzip, then open this folder as the project directory.
3. Within the terminal for this project directory, run the command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Within the terminal for this project directory, run the command: python -m flask run
5. Within the terminal a link will appear saying "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/" click on this to view the webpage

## How to use the web page:
1. First click register to register for an account
2. Input your desired username, then password, then confirmation password (that matches the original password), then click submit
3. Enter your full name, label, then a description for the account itself (eg: Hello! I am a student at Harvard!)
4. Feel free to check out the about page for more instructions and details about the project itself
5. Also feel free to go back to the account page and click on the links to change password or account description
6. Click onto the Analyze page
7. Input two dates: Start date and end date and hit submit
⋅⋅* Note: on Safari, datefields do not show up and the user will have to input dates as YYYY-MM-DD
⋅⋅* Ensure your start date is before the end date, and dates come after the specified date in the label
⋅⋅* Note: there is error checking to make sure this is correct
8. The web page will direct the user to Dexcom's login to authenticate the page
9. Enter username: victorg2001 and password: test1234
⋅⋅* I do not allow CS50 to distribute this login. These are my personal diabetic blood sugars and are very important to my health but I understand they are necessary for the program to run. 
⋅⋅* I have changed my password so that it can be used by CS50 but if possible, could an email be sent to: victorgoncalves@college.harvard.edu after reviewal so I can change this important password back?
10. Click on the user victorg2001, not CS50_Course_Heads hahaha
11. View the displayed graphs
12. Log out by clicking the link "Log Out" in the top right corner
